**📰 News Summarizer AI**

A lightweight AI-powered web app that fetches and summarizes the top global news articles in real time, delivering clear, concise summaries in under 100 words.



**🚩 Important Notes**

This project can only be run on your local machine. Due to the large space requirements of its models and dependencies, deploying it to third-party platforms is not recommended.

The application is still a work in progress. While you can view news summaries, some aspects of the summarization need further improvement, and several website features are yet to be added.

During local use, you might occasionally encounter a summarization error. If this happens, please ignore it and wait for the page to finish loading.
